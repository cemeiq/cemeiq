- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to implement machine learning algorithms from scratch.
- I'm working on side projects that involve the basic data science concepts/
- I'm working on publications related to the topic of knowledge graphs and document ranking.
- :book: I'm currently reading the books: Data Science from scratch and invent your own games python.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source tools for data science and machine learning.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Machine Learning and Data Science.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love eating muffins and I love trying different kinds of tea.
