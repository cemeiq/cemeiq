### Hi there, this is Iqra ðŸ‘‹

Apart from my research journey as a machine learning PhD student at University of Liverpool, I am a software engineer/Data Scientist. I like to build data science and machine learning side projects and write on anything related to Python and machine learning. <!--

**Strong Languages**: Python 
  
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [99-machine-Learning-Projects](https://github.com/cemeiq/99-ML-Learning-Projects),  an open-source, machine learning project committed to contribute a cool/fun exercise and solution that is useful for anyone (including themselves) in their journey of learning machine learning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to implement machine learning algorithms from scratch.
- I'm working on side projects from OmdenAI like the Kenya land Ownership project as a part-time Machine learning Engineer.
- I've recently been interested in contributing to open source python projects like Sugar Labs
- I'm working on publications related to the topic of knowledge graphs and document ranking.
- :book: I'm currently reading the books: Data Science from scratch and invent your own games python.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source tools for data science and machine learning.
- I'm working on writing more on things related to data science [https://iqra.hashnode.dev/](https://iqra.hashnode.dev/)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Machine Learning and Data Science.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love eating muffins and trying different kinds of tea.
